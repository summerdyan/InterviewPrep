// Just gonna give some notes on hash tables.

// HASH TABLES
// I was trying to insert an image into this text file, but I couldn't because apparently text files
// hash the information to make sure it only contains text...interesting.
// You can find the beautiful image under src, and it's called meme.jpeg

// FROM CTCI
// Hash tables are pretty efficient tables for looking stuff up (great data structure to use in interviews).
// Maps keys to values.

// INTERNET INFO
// Insertion and search are super fast, even if the table is large.

// HOW TO HASH
// Take the key value, modulo with table size, use the generated value as the index to store the value
// Linear Probing - if index value already taken, move to next empty cell one by one
// There are other variations of probing, but we'll just leave it at that for now.

// Okay, I think that's enough info for now. I'm gonna start programming this :)
